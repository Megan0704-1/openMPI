## Switch Statements
- In Ruby, `switch-statement` can take any expressions.
- Some language like Python, do not have a `switch-statement` because an `if-statement` with Boolean expressions is about the same thing.
- In C, the `switch-statement` is actually quite different
- It is a jump table.
- Instead of random Boolean expressions, you can only put expressions that result in integers.
- These int are used to calculate jumps from the top of the `switch`` to the part that matches that value.
